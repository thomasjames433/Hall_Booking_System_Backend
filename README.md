# Hall Booking System

This is a project that allows registered users to request the admin to book halls by giving details like the date,timing of event and hall they want. Admins approve of the requests. Makes sure 2 bookings do not intersect with each other Made using Django, Django REST Framework and Djangorestframework-simplejwt.

## Features:

- Does not allow bookings that clash with slots already approved by the admin
- Users are allowed to edit the requirements of their bookings. If they edit an already booked slot, the booking_status changes to 'pending'
- User authorization using JWT

## Important!

The admin must have created a hall for the users to access it. This way the number of halls can be modified

While giving an input to request a booking, follow the instructions below

"hallname":"Aryabhatta", // give it as hallname while adding and updating. We do not have to know the hall id, can give it just by knowing the name of the hall

"date": "2024-12-18",  // Date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format

"start_time": "21:30:00",  // Time in 'HH:MM:SS' format

"end_time": "22:00:00"  // Time in 'HH:MM:SS' format

The order is not important, but maintain the formats
